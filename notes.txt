shallow copy :(same reference point)
-> is a copy whose properties share the same references as those of the source object from which the copy was made.
-> when we change either the copy, it changes the src (obj) too.

deep copy:(different reference point)
-> is a copy whose properties do not share the same references as those of the source object from which the copy was made.
-> when we change either the copy, it doesn't change the src (obj) too.
